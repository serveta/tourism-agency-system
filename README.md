# tourism-agency-system
It was my Java-102 graduation project provided by [patika.dev](https://www.patika.dev/). You can check the project detail [here](https://app.patika.dev/courses/java-102/odev-turizm-acente).

## Used on this project
* Java Swing GUI (but the front-end side is not coded yet)
* Database: PostgreSQL
* MVC pattern

## Inside the project
* Operator and Manager can add/update/get/delete operations as required by their role.
* Customers can search hotels with date, name, or address.
* Customers can reserve a hotel room with whatever they want hostel type or room type.

## Shortcoming of the project
Although the majority of the back-end side of the project is coded, it has shortcomings. The project should also have a handy front-end.
